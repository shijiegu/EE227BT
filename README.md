# EE227BT
This is to archive the [EE227BT (2019 Fall Berkeley)](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~elghaoui/Teaching/EE227BT/index.html) project on Graphical Lasso with [Sebastian Prillo](https://sprillo.github.io/) and [Gonzalo Benegas](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/).
We derived in much greater details with minimal jumping steps than [Friedman et al., 2007](https://tibshirani.su.domains/ftp/graph.pdf) and related literature, and included a review on some more recent advances on the topic. We also provided a plain (directly following the equations) and fast implementation.
